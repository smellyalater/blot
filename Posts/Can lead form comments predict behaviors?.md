# Can lead form comments predict behaviors?

<img src="/images/leadForm.jpg" height="200" align="left"> 

When someone submitted a lead form on the site, they could write a comment that would be read by the support team. We wanted to know if a shopper was more or less likely to deposit based on the comments they wrote. We started building out two cohorts.

The first cohort was users that had deposited, and also written a comment into the lead form. The second cohort was users that did not deposit and also written a comment into the lead form.

We took the comments from each cohort, dumped them all into a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool to see if there was a difference. Unfortunately it was inconclusive! But all data is good data, so we learned that the words people generally used, didn’t correlate to depositing. Sure, we could have gone much deeper into the data. There are probably indicator words we could have homed in on. However considering there were still humans in the loop, they would’ve caught any of those signal words. We didn’t need to scale a solution at that time.

#### Background:
Between 2015-2020 I was responsible for all A/B testing, personalization and optimization for a luxury homebuilder’s website. The website’s “job” was to get users in touch with a sales person. The internet was very different back in the late teens and much of this technology is standard now, back then it wasn’t and required lots of people. I have sanitized this and won’t use real numbers so as not to share any proprietary information about the company. This post is about how I made the site better for people shopping for a home.
