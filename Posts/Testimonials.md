# Testimonials work duh
The marketing zeitgeist for years had talked about the benefits of social proof in the form of testimonials. Additionally, the brands we referenced as adjacent _and_ halo brands used social proof (I'll talk about how we determined adjacent/halo brands in another post). It was (and still is) a reliable method of building trust in a brand.

## How should we do it? 
Feeling confident that they would work on our site, we had to figure out where to place them. 
- _What about the homepage?_ Very few shoppers actually came in through the homepage.
- _What about our search page?_ It was one of our most popular pages on the site but that would just look ridiculous.
- _What about the community pages?_ Well...uh....hmmmmm....let's start there I guess.

Our survey team (homebuyers were given a survey 2 weeks after closing) was able to pull six thousand comments from surveys. I sifted as many as I could in 30 minutes and grabbed as many as I could that were completely generic, as in they only mentioned the homebuying process and I also grabbed ones that were specific to the community.

I forget exactly how many we used, but we wanted to make sure that users were very unlikely to see the same testimonial twice, it was something like 60 testimonials that would randomly display on any community page. We randomly generated the order so that users were seeing fresh (to them) tesimonials each time.

Next up, how to deploy it. Many of our A/B tests I would code and deliver via our A/B testing software du jour. This one, becuase we we were pretty confident testimonials would work, the engineers built out a testimonial container and our A/B testing software would _hide_ the container. A successful test would have a drop in leads.

## Yay -17%
Remember, the test variant hid the testimonials so a drop in leads was great. We saw a 17% drop in leads, that's huge. 17% freaking percent. Validated and quantified, we stopped the test and launched the testimonials site wide.

### Background:

Between 2015-2020 I was responsible for all A/B testing, personalization and optimization for a luxury homebuilder’s website. The website’s “job” was to get users in touch with a sales person. The internet was very different back in the late teens and much of this technology is standard now, back then it wasn’t and required lots of people. I have sanitized this and won’t use real numbers so as not to share any proprietary information about the company. The point of this blog isn't to blow your mind, it's to show the _process_ I/we went through to arrive at our conclusions.
