# Do people shop for a home or a neighborhood?

The company I worked for built huge neighborhoods - "communities" in the biz. They were responsible for building the individual home, the streets any community amenities (pool, playground, clubhouse, etc) and all of the surrounding homes. They would take anywhere from 2-10 years to complete based on how quickly the homes sold.

Weren't sure what was more compelling...the home and would be willing to settle on a neighborhood or a neighborhood, and would be willing to settle on a home in that neighborhood.
